### Key Features

- Application Load Balancer (HTTP)
- Auto Scaling Group (2+ EC2 instances)
- Dockerised Flask app with a dashboard for live performance metrics

### Architecture

The infrastructure consists of a load balancer distributing traffic across two EC2 servers within an Auto Scaling Group.
